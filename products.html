            <p><strong>Equipment Finance Corporation</strong> is dedicated to helping businesses become more productive, more competitive and more
profitable.</p>

<p>Equipment Finance Corporation delivers innovative and flexible financial products and structures to serve your needs and
preserve your cash and liquidity. Our product offerings and structuring expertise also aid in debt, tax and balance
sheet management.</p>

<p>Our vast portfolio of product offerings and structuring options include:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Capital and Operating Leases, Capital Loans, Debt Refinancing, Sale-Leasebacks, Tax-Oriented Full Service Leases, Off-Balance Sheet Financings, Fixed Rates, Floating Rates, Adjustable Rates, Variable Terms, Variable Structures, Variable Termination, Variable Purchase Options</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Leases</strong></p>

<p>Leasing offers a business some significant benefits in managing its balance sheet and cash reserves.
Since the equipment is owned by the Lessor, leased equipment, in many cases, is not included on a business’s balance
sheet. This improves debt-to-equity ratios and the business’s overall credit position. Leasing is a financing
alternative for businesses that are unable to take advantage of accelerated tax depreciation. Leasing can also provide
a hedge against equipment obsolescence.</p>

<p><strong>Loans</strong></p>

<p>In a Loan transaction, EFC provides financing secured by a lien in the acquired equipment. The purchaser receives all benefits of ownership.</p>

<p>Loans made or arranged pursuant to a California Financing Law License.</p>

<p><strong>Sale-Leasebacks</strong></p>

<p>In a sale-leaseback, a business sells some or all of its capital equipment to EFC and then we immediately lease the
equipment back. A sale-leaseback provides you with a cash infusion and improves your balance sheet by removing the debt
associated with the equipment.</p>

<p><strong>Refinancing</strong></p>

<p>Financing new or used equipment or refinancing your current debt can free up cash for working capital. Financing appeals
to customers with longer equipment needs and builds equity with every payment. Our loans are tailored with flexible
payment terms to match your budgetary needs and goals.</p>

<p>Refinancing, in particular, helps you uncover hidden equity in your assets. EFC can consolidate existing equipment loans
into one transaction with one monthly payment. Refinancing allows you to improve cash flow and lower financing costs. In
addition, the current equipment value may exceed your remaining debt, thus allowing you to increase the amount you borrow.</p>

<p><strong>Off-Balance Sheet Financing</strong></p>

<p>Off-balance sheet financing is a loan for IRS purposes but uses lease documentation and is subject to lease accounting.
Through this structure, a business can receive ownership tax benefits without incurring debt on its balance sheet for
accounting purposes.</p>
